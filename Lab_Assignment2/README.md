This is our second assignment in this course and it focuses on implementing and analyzing polynomial curve fitting using Least Squares Estimation (LSE), comparing unweighted and weighted approaches to understand their effects on fitting noisy data to a true underlying function.
It also involves implementing a non-linear least squares estimation (LSE) algorithm to determine a receiver's position using satellite pseudorange measurements and known satellite positions.

This assignment focuses on building, optimizing, and evaluating machine learning classifiers using inertial sensor data for motion state recognition. Through a series of sections, different models are trained using a range of feature selection techniques, including all features, manually selected features, group-selected features, and features derived from dimensionality reduction with PCA. The assignment utilizes algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, applying grid search and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. The models' performances are compared, highlighting the impact of feature selection and algorithm choice on classification accuracy, robustness, and generalization across various test datasets.
